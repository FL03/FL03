# About

_**Welcome to my GitHub!**_

I'm a curios dilettante interested in a myriad of technical subjects ranging from artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science to pure mathematics, music theory, and more. A majority of my code is written in Rust, however, I also have a strong background in Python and am familiar with the standard web languages (css/html/js) as well as flutter, lean, and solidity. Use any of my code with caution, particularly older projects, as I have long used this platform to help me learn the ins-and-outs of developing software.

## Interests

* Artificial Intelligence
* Computation
* Decentalization and Distributed Systems
* Engineering
* Mathematics

## Projects

A majority of my coding is in support of some research that I am currently doing, so many of them are still early in development. That being said, several of my projects are becoming more refined and may be applicable for others.

* [`acme`](https://github.com/FL03/acme): an automatic differentiation tool; sunsetted due to upcoming feature integration
* [`concision`](https://github.com/FL03/concision): a machine learning toolkit for rust
* [`rstm`](https://github.com/FL03/rstm): this crate implements concrete abstractions for experiementing with Turing machine models
* [`rstmt`](https://github.com/FL03/rstmt): a crate implementing various musical objects and primitives
