_**Welcome to my GitHub!**_

## About

I am a curios dilettante interested in a myriad of technical subjects. I almost exclusively write code in rust, however, am well-versed in python and am familiar with flutter, lean, javascript, and solidity.

### Topics of interest

* Artificial Intelligence
* Computation
* Decentalization and Distributed Systems
* Engineering
* Mathematics

## Projects

A majority of my coding is in support of some research that I am currently doing, so many of them are still early in development. That being said, several of my projects are becoming more refined and may be applicable for others.

* [`acme`](https://github.com/FL03/acme): an automatic differentiation tool; sunsetted due to upcoming feature integration
* [`concision`](https://github.com/FL03/concision): a machine learning toolkit for rust
* [`rstm`](https://github.com/FL03/rstm): this crate implements concrete abstractions for experiementing with Turing machine models
* [`rstmt`](https://github.com/FL03/rstmt): a crate implementing various musical objects and primitives
