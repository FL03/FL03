Thank you for stopping by!

While I am a dilettante interested in a myriad of technical subjects, I almost exlusivley write code in rust but am well-versed in python and familiar with flutter, javascript, solidity, and lean.

## Currently...

I am currently focused on exploring the compurational implications of the Neo-Riemannian theory of music. 

## Projects

A majority of my coding is in support of some research that I am currently doing, so many of them are still early in development. That being said, several of my projects are becoming more refined and may be applicable for others.

* [`acme`](https://github.com/FL03/acme): an automatic differentiation tool; sunsetted due to upcoming feature integration
* [`concision`](https://github.com/FL03/concision): a machine learning toolkit for rust
* [`rstm`](https://github.com/FL03/rstm): this crate implements concrete abstractions for experiementing with Turing machine models
* [`rstmt`](https://github.com/FL03/rstmt): a crate implementing various musical objects and primitives
